  "description": "DICOM Send utilizes DCMTK's storescu to send DICOM data from a Flywheel instance to a destination DICOM server, hosted externally. This Gear supports the transmission of individual DICOM files and archives, as well as the transmission of an entire session when a specific input is not provided. Note that a private tag is added to each DICOM file to be transmitted (Flywheel:DICOM Send, at group 0x0021). Importantly, the external DICOM server must be reachable from the engine host of the Flywheel instance.",
